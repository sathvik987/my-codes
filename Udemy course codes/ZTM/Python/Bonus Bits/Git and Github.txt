1. Go to github website
2. Start a project
3. Name the repository anything you want
4. select 'Initialize this repository with a README'
5. Clone with HTTPS, copy the url
6. Open console, and go to the folder where you have kept the files
7. >git clone <url>
8. A folder with the project name will be created. Place all the files inside that folder.
9. go to that folder from console.
10. >git status
this will show all the files that have been modified.
11. >git add <filename>
or
>git add .
to add all the files at once.
12. >git status
13. >git commit -m "message that will be shown when someone sees the commits. Just try to add a short message describing the changes committed."
14. >git push
sometimes this command does not work, in that case it will ask to use a different command. Use that one then.
15. >git pull
if someone has made the changes in the github page, then use this command to update your local files with the latest changes.


>git branch
to see all the branches available

>git branch <new_branch_name>
to create a new branch

>git checkout <branch_name>
to work in different branch

if we want to merge from our branch to the master branch, then add, commit then (before you push)
go to master branch, pull, then go back to your branch and do
>git merge master
if there is any conflict, then it will error out and show the conflict.
conflict in the sense, while we were changing, someone else has changed the code in master branch.
